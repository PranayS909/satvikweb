            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Satvik Ahaar, deeply rooted in the traditions of ancient India, represents more than just a diet—it is a holistic way of living that aligns food choices with physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Derived from the Sanskrit word “Satva,” meaning purity and harmony, this dietary philosophy emphasizes balance, mindfulness, and health.</p>
            <p>At its core, Satvik Ahaar is about consuming fresh, wholesome, and minimally processed foods that are easy to digest and nourish the body and mind. The diet avoids overly spicy, oily, or stale foods, as well as stimulants like caffeine and alcohol, which are believed to disturb inner peace and clarity.</p>
